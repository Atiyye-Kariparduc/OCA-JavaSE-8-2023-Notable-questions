// *** enhanced loop can walk through the elements of array in order ***

/*
* Given the code fragment:
* And given the requirements:
* 1. Process all the elements of the array in the order of entry.
* 2. Process all the elements of the array in the reverse order of entry.
* 3. Process alternating elements of the array in the order of entry. 
* 		Which two statements are true? (Choose two.)
*
*
A. Requirements 1, 2, and 3 can be implemented by using the enhanced for loop.
B. Requirements 1, 2, and 3 can be implemented by using the standard for loop.        √
C. Requirements 2 and 3 CANNOT be implemented by using the standard for loop.
D. Requirement 1 can be implemented by using the enhanced for loop.						√
E. Requirement 3 CANNOT be implemented by using either the enhanced for loop or the standard for loop.
